To test for the correctness of our program, we run the programs with different matrices files and check if the output matches what we expected.

This assignment was quite confusing as how to best implement MATLAB in to C, but we digress and it all worked out. We struggled with keeping the
variables in check, probably because we wrote too many functions so some varibles got mixed up and program didn't run like we expected.

We tried our best to make sure we both contribute 50% each over about 5-hour period in total for each of us.
