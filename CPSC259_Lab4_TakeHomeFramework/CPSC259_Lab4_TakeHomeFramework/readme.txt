To test for the correctness of our program, we run the programs with different maze files and check if the output matches what we expected.

This assignment was quite straighforward, however, we did struggle with how gradescope expects the output to be, especially at the cheapest_path_info
function. We used integer for sprintf function however gradescope doesn't like that so we had to convert it to string.

We tried our best to make sure we both contribute 50% each over about 5-hour period in total for each of us.
