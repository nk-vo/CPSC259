To test for the correctness of our program, we use the unittest1.cpp provided and continuously run tests until all tests
has passed and turns green.

This assignment was quite straighforward, however, we did struggle with node pointer and it was quite difficult to
visualize what does what (i.e. where the pointer is pointing to after an execution). We overcome them simply by
drawing them out by hand and redirect the pointers to theirs respective location

We tried our best to make sure we both contribute 50% each over about 5-hour period in total for each of us.
