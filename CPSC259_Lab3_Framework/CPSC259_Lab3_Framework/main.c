/*
 Main function drives the program.  Every C program must have one
 main function.  A project will not compile without one.

 In our program, the main function does nothing.  That's because
 our program doesn't do anything.  We're just implementing a linked
 list and testing it using our unit tests.

 You may add your own code for testing if you wish.

 PRE:    NULL (no pre-conditions)
 POST:	 NULL (no side-effects)
 RETURN: IF the program exits correctly
     THEN 0 ELSE 1
